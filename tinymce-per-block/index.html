Like I mentioned before, the longer it’s been since the last release the more pressure there is, but if you know that if your bit of code doesn’t make this version but there’s the +0.1 coming out in 6 weeks, then it’s not that bad. It’s like flights from San Francisco to LA, if you miss one you know there’s another one an hour later so it’s not a big deal. Amazon has done a fantastic job of this with the Kindle as well, with a new model every year.<!-- /wp -->\n\n<!-- wp:text -->I like Apple for the opposite reason: <strong>they’re not afraid of getting a rudimentary 1.0 out into the world</strong>.<!-- /wp -->\n\n<!-- wp:image --><img src="https://matiasventura.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/blue.png?w=720"><!-- /wp -->';
