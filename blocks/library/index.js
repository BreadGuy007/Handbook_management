		// FIXME: Temporary fix.
		//
		// The Shortcode block declares a catch-all shortcode transform,
		// meaning it will attempt to intercept pastes and block conversions of
		// any valid shortcode-like content. Other blocks (e.g. Gallery) may
		// declare specific shortcode transforms (e.g. `[gallery]`), with which
		// this block would conflict. Thus, the Shortcode block needs to be
		// registered as early as possible, so that any other block types'
		// shortcode transforms can be honoured.
		//
		// This isn't a proper solution, as it is at odds with the
		// specification of shortcode conversion, in the sense that conversion
		// is explicitly independent of block order. Thus, concurrent parse
		// rules (i.e. a same text input can yield two different transforms,
		// like `[gallery] -> { Gallery, Shortcode }`) are unsupported,
		// yielding non-deterministic results. A proper solution could be to
		// let the editor (or site owners) determine a default block handler of
		// unknown shortcodes â€” see `setUnknownTypeHandlerName`.
