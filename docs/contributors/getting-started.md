# Getting Started

The following guide is for setting up your local environment to contribute to the Gutenberg project. There is significant overlap between an environment to contribute and an environment used to extend the WordPress block editor. You can review the [Development Enviornment tutorial](/docs/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/devenv/readme.md) for additional setup information.

## Development Tools (Node)

Gutenberg is a JavaScript project and requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The project is built using the latest active LTS release of node, and the latest verion of NPM. See the [LTS release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) for details.

We recommend using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm) since it is the easiest way to install and manage node for macOS, Linux, and Windows 10 using WSL2. See [our Development Tools guide](/docs/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/devenv/readme.md#development-tools) or the Nodejs site for additional installation instructions.

After installing Node, you can build Gutenberg by running the following from within the cloned repository:


```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

> Note: The install scripts require [Python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed and in the path of the local system. This might be installed by default for your operating system, or require downloading and installing.

Once built, Gutenberg is ready to be used as a WordPress plugin!

`npm run build` creates a single build of the project once. While developing, you probably will want to use `npm run dev` to run continuous builds automatically as source files change. The dev build also includes additional warnings and errors to help troubleshoot while developing.

## Local Environment

If you are familiar with WordPress and already have an environment setup, use the above build as a standard WordPress plugin by putting the gutenberg directory in your wp-content/plugins/ directory.

If you do not have a local WordPress environment setup, follow the steps in the rest of this section to create one.

### Using wp-env to Install a Local Environment

The [wp-env package](/packages/env/README.md) was developed with the Gutneberg project as a quick way to create a standard WordPress environment using Docker. It is also published as the `@wordpress/env` npm package.

By default, `wp-env` can run in a plugin direcotry to create and run a WordPress enviornment, mounting and activating the plugin automatically. You can also configure `wp-env` to use existing installs, multiple plugins, or themes. See the [wp-env package](/packages/env/README.md#wp-envjson) for complete documentation.

If you don't already have it, you'll need to install Docker and Docker Compose in order to use `wp-env`. See the [Developement Environment tutorial for additional details](/docs/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/devenv/readme.md).

Once Docker is installed and running: To install WordPress, run the following from within the cloned gutenberg directory:

```bash
npm run wp-env start
```

> Note: `npm run` will use the version specified within the Gutenberg project, making sure you are running the latest wp-env version.

To stop the running environment:

```bash
npm run wp-env stop
```

To destroy the install completely:

```bash
npm run wp-env destroy
```

Explore the [package documentation](/packages/env/README.md) for additional commands.


#### Accessing the Local WordPress Install

The WordPress installation should now be available at `http://localhost:8888`

You can access the Dashboard at: `http://localhost:8888/wp-admin/` using **Username**: `admin`, **Password**: `password`.  You'll notice the Gutenberg plugin installed and activated, this is your local build.

#### Troubleshooting

If you run into an issue, check the [troubleshooting section in `wp-env` documentation](/packages/env/README.md#troubleshooting-common-problems).

### Using Local or MAMP

You can also use [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com/), [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/), or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) as alternative environments to run a local WordPress environment. To do so clone and install Gutenberg as a regular plugin in your installation by creating a symlink or copying the directory to the proper `wp-content/plugins` directory.

You will also need some extra configuration to be able to run the e2e tests.

Change the current directory to the plugins folder and symlink all e2e test plugins:

```bash
ln -s gutenberg/packages/e2e-tests/plugins/* .
```

You'll need to run this again if new plugins are added. To run e2e tests:

```bash
WP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888/gutenberg npm run test-e2e
```

### Caching of PHP files

You'll need to disable OPCache in order to correctly work on PHP files. To fix:

- Go to **MAMP > Preferences > PHP**
- Under **Cache**, select **off**
- Confirm with **OK**

### Incoming connections

By default, the web server (Apache) launched by MAMP will listen to all incoming connections, not just local ones. This means that anyone on the same local network (and, in certain cases, anyone on the Internet) can access your web server. This may be intentional and useful for testing sites on other devices, but most often this can be a privacy or security issue. Keep this in mind and don't store sensitive information in this server.

While it is possible to fix this, you should fix it at your own risk, since it breaks MAMP's ability to parse web server configurations and, as a result, makes MAMP think that Apache is listening to the wrong port. Consider switching away from MAMP. Otherwise, you can use the following:

- Edit `/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf`
- Change `Listen 8888` to `Listen 127.0.0.1:8888`

### Linking to other directories

You may like to create links in your `plugins` and `themes` directories to other folders, e.g.

- wp-content/plugins/gutenberg -> ~/projects/gutenberg
- wp-content/themes/twentytwenty -> ~/projects/twentytwenty

If so, you need to instruct Apache to allow following such links:

- Open or start a new file at `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/.htaccess`
- Add the following line: `Options +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch`

## On A Remote Server
=======
### On A Remote Server
>>>>>>> Docs: Refresh Getting Started guide

You can use a remote server in development by building locally and then uploading the built files as a plugin to the remote server.

To build: open a terminal (or if on Windows, a command prompt) and navigate to the repository you cloned. Now type `npm install` to get the dependencies all set up. Once that finishes, you can type `npm run build`.

After building the cloned gutenberg directory contains the complete plugin, you can upload the entire repository to your `wp-content/plugins` directory and activate the plugin from the WordPress admin.

Another way to upload after building is to run `npm run build:plugin-zip` to create a plugin zip file â€” this requires `bash` and `php` to run. The script creates `gutenberg.zip` that you can use to install Gutenberg through the WordPress admin.

## Storybook

> Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, React Native and more. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

The Gutenberg repository also includes [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) integration that allows testing and developing in a WordPress-agnostic context. This is very helpful for developing reusable components and trying generic JavaScript modules without any backend dependency.

You can launch Storybook by running `npm run storybook:dev` locally. It will open in your browser automatically.

You can also test Storybook for the current `master` branch on GitHub Pages: [https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/)

## Developer Tools

We recommend configuring your editor to automatically check for syntax and lint errors. This will help you save time as you develop by automatically fixing minor formatting issues. Here are some directions for setting up Visual Studio Code, a popular editor used by many of the core developers, these tools are also available for other editors.

### EditorConfig

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) defines a standard configuration for setting up your editor, for example using tabs instead of spaces. You should install the [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=editorconfig.editorconfig) extension and it will automatically configure your editor to match the rules defined in [.editorconfig](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/.editorconfig).

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) statically analyzes the code to find problems. The lint rules are integrated in the continuous integration process and must pass to be able to commit. You should install the [ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for Visual Studio Code, see eslint docs for [more editor integrations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).

With the extension installed, ESLint will use the [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) file in the root of the Gutenberg repository for formatting rules. It will highlight issues as you develop, you can also set the following preference to fix lint rules on save.

```json
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    },
```

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a tool that allows you to define an opinionated format, and automate fixing the code to match that format. Prettier and ESlint are similar, Prettier is more about formatting and style, while ESlint is for detecting coding errors.

To use Prettier with Visual Studio Code, you should install the [Prettier - Code formatter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). You can then configure it to be the default formatter and to automatically fix issues on save, by adding the following to your settings. __**Note**: depending on where you are viewing htis document, the brackets may show as double, the proper format is just a single bracket.__

```json
"[[javascript]]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
"[[markdown]]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
```

This will use the `.prettierrc.js` file included in the root of the Gutenberg repository. The config is included from the [@wordpress/prettier-config](/packages/prettier-config/README.md) package.

If you only want to use this configuration with the Gutenberg project, create a directory called .vscode at the top-level of Gutenberg, and place your settings in a settings.json there. Visual Studio Code refers to this as Workplace Settings, and only apply to the project.

For other editors, see [Prettier's Editor Integration docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

### TypeScript

**TypeScript** is a typed superset of JavaScript language. The Gutenberg project uses TypeScript via JSDoc to [type check JavaScript files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-checking-javascript-files.html). If you use Visual Studio Code, TypeScript support is built-in, otherwise see [TypeScript Editor Support](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support) for editor integrations.
