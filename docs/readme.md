# Gutenberg Handbook

The Gutenberg project provides three sources of documentation:

## Designer & Developer Handbook

Learn how to build blocks and extend the editor, best practices for designing block interfaces, and how to create themes that make the most of the new features Gutenberg provides.

Start with [the Designer & Developer Handbook](/docs/designers-developers/readme.md) to learn the background and concepts, or jump straight to [Gutenberg Tutorials](/docs/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/readme.md) for detailed examples.

## User Handbook

Discover the new features WordPress offers, learn how your site will be affected by the new editor and how to keep using the old interface, and tips for creating beautiful posts and pages.

See [the WordPress Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/) support documentation.
