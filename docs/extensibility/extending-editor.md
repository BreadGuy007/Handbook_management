# Extending Editor (Experimental)

[Hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/) are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code. They make up the foundation for how plugins and themes interact with Gutenberg, but theyâ€™re also used extensively by WordPress Core itself. There are two types of hooks: [Actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [Filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/). They were initially implemented in PHP, but for the purpose of Gutenberg they were ported to JavaScript and published to npm as [@wordpress/hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/hooks) package for general purpose use. You can also learn more about both APIs: [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/WordPress/packages/tree/master/packages/hooks).

## Modifying Editor

To modify the behavior of the editor experience, Gutenberg exposes the following Filters:

### `editor.PostFeaturedImage.imageSize`

Used to modify the image size displayed in the Post Featured Image component. It defaults to `'post-thumbnail'`, and will fail back to the `full` image size when the specified image size doesn't exist in the media object. It's modeled after the `admin_post_thumbnail_size` filter in the Classic Editor.

_Example:_

```js
var withImageSize = function( size, mediaId, postId ) {
	return 'large';
};

wp.hooks.addFilter( 'editor.PostFeaturedImage.imageSize', 'my-plugin/with-image-size', withImageSize );
```
