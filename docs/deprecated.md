Gutenberg's deprecation policy is intended to support backwards-compatibility for two minor releases, when possible. The current deprecations are listed below and are grouped by _the version at which they will be removed completely_. If your plugin depends on these behaviors, you must update to the recommended alternative before the noted version.
