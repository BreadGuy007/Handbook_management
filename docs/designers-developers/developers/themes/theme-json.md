## Rationale

The Block Editor surface API has evolved at different velocities, and it's now at a point where is showing some growing pains, specially in areas that affect themes. Examples of this are: the ability to [control the editor programmatically](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/01/23/controlling-the-block-editor/), or [a block style system](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9534) that facilitates user, theme, and core style preferences.

This describes the current efforts to consolidate the various APIs into a single point – a `experimental-theme.json` file that should be located inside the root of the theme directory.

### Settings can be controlled per block

The Block Editor already allows the control of specific settings such as alignment, drop cap, whether it's present in the inserter, etc at the block level. The goal is to surface these for themes to control at a block level.

### CSS Custom Properties

Presets such as [color palettes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-color-palettes), [font sizes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-font-sizes), and [gradients](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-gradient-presets) become CSS Custom Properties, and will be enqueued by the system for themes to use in both the front-end and the editors. There's also a mechanism to create your own CSS Custom Properties.

### Some block styles are managed

By providing the block style properties in a structured way, the Block Editor can "manage" the CSS that comes from different origins (user, theme, and core CSS), reducing the amount of CSS loaded in the page and preventing specificity wars due to the competing needs of the components involved (themes, blocks, plugins).

## Specification

The `experimental-theme.json` file is divided into sections known as "contexts", that represent a different CSS selector. For example, the `core/paragraph` context maps to `p` while `core/group` maps to `.wp-block-group`. In general, one block will map to a single context as in the cases mentioned. There are cases where one block can generate multiple contexts (different CSS selectors). For example, the heading block generates six different contexts (`core/heading/h1`, `core/heading/h2`, etc), one for each different selector (h1, h2, etc).

```
{
  "global": { ... },
  "core/paragraph": { ... },
  "core/group": { ... },
  "core/heading/h1": { ... },
  "core/heading/h2": { ... },
  "core/heading/h3": { ... },
  "core/heading/h4": { ... },
  "core/heading/h5": { ... },
  "core/heading/h6": { ... }
}
```

Every context has the same structure, divided in two sections: `settings` and `styles`. The `settings` are used to control the editor (enable/disable certain features, declare presets), taking over what was previously declared via `add_theme_support`. The `styles` will be used to create new style rules to be appended to a new stylesheet `global-styles-inline-css` enqueued in the front-end and post editor.

```
{
  "some/context": {
    "settings": {
      "border": [ ... ],
      "color": [ ... ],
      "custom": [ ... ],
      "spacing": [ ... ],
      "typography": [ ... ]
    },
    "styles": {
      "border": { ... },
      "color": { ... },
      "typography": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

This structure is the same for the three different origins that exist: core, themes, and users. Themes can override core's defaults by creating a file called `experimental-theme.json`. Users, via the site editor, will also be also to override theme's or core's preferences via an user interface that is being worked on.

### Settings

The settings section has the following structure and default values:

```
{
  "some/context": {
    "settings": {
      "border": {
        "customRadius": false /* true to opt-in */
      },
      "color": {
        "custom": true, /* false to opt-out, as in add_theme_support('disable-custom-colors') */
        "customGradient": true, /* false to opt-out, as in add_theme_support('disable-custom-gradients') */
        "gradients": [ ... ], /* gradient presets, as in add_theme_support('editor-gradient-presets', ... ) */
        "link": false, /* true to opt-in, as in add_theme_support('experimental-link-color') */
        "palette": [ ... ], /* color presets, as in add_theme_support('editor-color-palette', ... ) */
      },
      "custom": { ... },
      "spacing": {
        "customPadding": false, /* true to opt-in, as in add_theme_support('custom-spacing') */
        "units": [ "px", "em", "rem", "vh", "vw" ], /* filter values, as in add_theme_support('custom-units', ... ) */
      },
      "typography": {
        "customFontSize": true, /* false to opt-out, as in add_theme_support( 'disable-custom-font-sizes' ) */
        "customFontWeight": true, /* false to opt-out */
        "customFontStyle": true, /* false to opt-out */
        "customLineHeight": false, /* true to opt-in, as in add_theme_support( 'custom-line-height' ) */
        "dropCap": true, /* false to opt-out */
        "fontFamilies": [ ... ], /* font family presets */
        "fontSizes": [ ... ], /* font size presets, as in add_theme_support('editor-font-sizes', ... ) */
        "fontStyles": [ ... ], /* font style presets */
        "fontWeights": [ ... ], /* font weight presets */
        "textDecorations": [ ... ], /* text decoration presets */
        "textTransforms": [ ... ] /* text transform presets */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To retain backward compatibility, `add_theme_support` declarations are retrofit in the proper categories. If a theme uses `add_theme_support('disable-custom-colors')`, it'll be the same as set `global.settings.color.custom` to `false`. If the `experimental-theme.json` contains any settings, these will take precedence over the values declared via `add_theme_support`.

Settings can also be controlled by context, providing a more fine-grained control over what exists via `add_theme_support`. As an example, let's say that a theme author wants to enable custom colors for the paragraph block exclusively. This is how it'd be done:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "settings": {
      "color": {
        "custom": false
      }
    }
  },
  "core/paragraph": {
    "settings": {
      "color": {
        "custom": true
      }
    }
  }
```

Note, however, that not all settings are relevant for all contexts and the blocks they represent. The settings section provides an opt-in/opt-out mechanism for themes, but it's the block's responsibility to add support for the features that are relevant to it. For example, if a block doesn't implement the `dropCap` feature, a theme can't enable it for such a block through `experimental-theme.json`.

#### Presets

Presets are part of the settings section. At the moment, they only work within the `global` context. Each preset value will generate a CSS Custom Property that will be added to the new stylesheet, which follow this naming schema: `--wp--preset--{preset-category}--{preset-slug}`.

For example, for this input:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "settings": {
      "color": {
        "palette": [
          {
            "slug": "strong-magenta",
            "color": "#a156b4"
          },
          {
            "slug": "very-dark-grey",
            "color": "rgb(131, 12, 8)"
          }
        ],
        "gradients": [
          {
            "slug": "blush-bordeaux",
            "gradient": "linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(254,205,165) 0%,rgb(254,45,45) 50%,rgb(107,0,62) 100%)"
          },
          {
            "slug": "blush-light-purple",
            "gradient": "linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(255,206,236) 0%,rgb(152,150,240) 100%)"
          },
        ]
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontSizes": [
          {
            "slug": "normal",
            "size": 16
          },
          {
            "slug": "big",
            "size": 32
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The output to be enqueued will be:

```css
:root {
  --wp--preset--color--strong-magenta: #a156b4;
  --wp--preset--color--very-dark-gray: #444;
  --wp--preset--font-size--big: 32;
  --wp--preset--font-size--normal: 16;
  --wp--preset--gradient--blush-bordeaux: linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(254,205,165) 0%,rgb(254,45,45) 50%,rgb(107,0,62) 100%);
  --wp--preset--gradient--blush-light-purple: linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(255,206,236) 0%,rgb(152,150,240) 100%);
}
```

The goal is that presets can be defined using this format, although, right now, the name property (used in the editor) can't be translated from this file. For that reason, and to maintain backward compatibility, the presets declared via `add_theme_support` will also generate the CSS Custom Properties. If the `experimental-theme.json` contains any presets, these will take precedence over the ones declared via `add_theme_support`.

#### Free-form CSS Custom Properties

In addition to create CSS Custom Properties for the presets, the theme.json also allows for themes to create their own, so they don't have to be enqueued separately. Any values declared within the `settings.custom` section will be transformed to CSS Custom Properties following this naming schema: `--wp--custom--<variable-name>`.

For example, for this input:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "settings": {
      "custom": {
        "base-font": 16,
        "line-height": {
          "small": 1.2,
          "medium": 1.4,
          "large": 1.8
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The output will be:

```css
:root {
  --wp--custom--base-font: 16;
  --wp--custom--line-height--small: 1.2;
  --wp--custom--line-height--medium: 1.4;
  --wp--custom--line-height--large: 1.8;
}
```

Note that, the name of the variable is created by adding `--` in between each nesting level.

### Styles

Each block declares which style properties it exposes. This has been coined as "implicit style attributes" of the block. These properties are then used to automatically generate the UI controls for the block in the editor, as well as being available through the `experimental-theme.json` file for themes to target.

```json
{
  "some/context": {
    "styles": {
      "border": {
        "radius": "value"
      },
      "color": {
        "background": "value",
        "gradient": "value",
        "link": "value",
        "text": "value"
      },
      "spacing": {
        "padding": {
          "top": "value",
          "right": "value",
          "bottom": "value",
          "left": "value",
        },
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontFamily": "value",
        "fontSize": "value",
        "fontStyle": "value",
        "fontWeight": "value",
        "lineHeight": "value",
        "textDecoration": "value",
        "textTransform": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For example, an input like this:

```json
{
  "core/heading/h1": {
    "styles": {
      "color": {
        "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--primary)"
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontSize": "calc(1px * var(--wp--preset--font-size--huge))"
      }
    }
  },
  "core/heading/h4": {
    "styles": {
      "color": {
        "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--secondary)"
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontSize": "var(--wp--preset--font-size--normal)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

will append the following style rules to the stylesheet:

```css
h1 {
  color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary);
  font-size: calc(1px * var(--wp--preset--font-size--huge));
}
h4 {
  color: var(--wp--preset--color--secondary);
  font-size: calc(1px * var(--wp--preset--font-size--normal));
}
```
