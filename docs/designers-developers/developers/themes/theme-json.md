## Rationale

The Block Editor API has evolved at different velocities and there are some growing pains, specially in areas that affect themes. Examples of this are: the ability to [control the editor programmatically](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/01/23/controlling-the-block-editor/), or [a block style system](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9534) that facilitates user, theme, and core style preferences.

This describes the current efforts to consolidate the various APIs related to styles into a single point – a `experimental-theme.json` file that should be located inside the root of the theme directory.

### Settings can be controlled per block

The Block Editor already allows the control of specific settings such as alignment, drop cap, presets available, etc. All of these work at the block level. By using the `experimental-theme.json` we aim to allow themes to control these at a block level.

Examples of what can be achieved are:

- Use a particular preset for a block (e.g.: table) but the common one for the rest of blocks.
- Enable font size UI controls for all blocks that support it but the headings block.
- etc.

### Some block styles are managed

By using the `experimental-theme.json` file to set style properties in a structured way, the Block Editor can "manage" the CSS that comes from different origins (user, theme, and core CSS). For example, if a theme and a user set the font size for paragraphs, we only enqueue the style coming from the user and not the theme's.

Some of the advantages are:

- Reduce the amount of CSS enqueued. 
- Prevent specificity wars.

### CSS Custom Properties

There are some areas of styling that would benefit from having shared values that can change across a site instantly.

To address this need, we've started to experiment with CSS Custom Properties, aka CSS Variables, in some places:

- **Presets**: [color palettes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-color-palettes), [font sizes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-font-sizes), or [gradients](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#block-gradient-presets) declared by the theme are converted to CSS Custom Properties and enqueued both the front-end and the editors.

{% codetabs %}
{% Input %}
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "color": {
        "palette": [
          {
            "name": "Black",
            "slug": "black",
            "color": "#000000"
          },
          {
            "name": "White",
            "slug": "white",
            "color": "#ffffff"
          }
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```
{% Output %}
```css
:root {
  --wp--preset--color--black: #000000;
  --wp--preset--color--white: #ffffff;
}
```
{% end %}

- **Custom properties**: there's also a mechanism to create your own CSS Custom Properties.

{% codetabs %}
{% Input %}
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "custom": {
        "line-height": {
          "body": 1.7,
          "heading": 1.3
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
{% Output %}
```css
:root {
  --wp--custom--line-height--body: 1.7;
  --wp--custom--line-height--heading: 1.3;
}
```
{% end %}

## Specification

This specification is the same for the three different origins that use this format: core, themes, and users. Themes can override core's defaults by creating a file called `experimental-theme.json`. Users, via the site editor, will also be also to override theme's or core's preferences via an user interface that is being worked on.

The `experimental-theme.json` file declares how a theme wants the editor configured (`settings`) as well as the style properties it sets (`styles`).

```
{
  "settings": { ... },
  "styles": { ... }
}
```

Both settings and styles can contain subsections for any registered block. As a general rule, the names of these subsections will be the block names ― we call them "block selectors". For example, the paragraph block ―whose name is `core/paragraph`― can be addressed in the settings using the key (or "block selector") `core/paragraph`:

```
{
  "settings": {
    "core/paragraph": { ... }
  }
}
```

There are a few cases in whiche a single block can represent different HTML markup. The heading block is one of these, as it represents h1 to h6 HTML elements. In these cases, the block will have as many block selectors as different markup variations ― `core/heading/h1`, `core/heading/h2`, etc, so they can be addressed separately:

```
{
  "styles": {
    "core/heading/h1": { ... },
    // ...
    "core/heading/h6": { ... },
  }
}
```

Additionally, there are two other block selectors: `root` and `defaults`. The `root` block selector represents the root of the site. The `defaults` block selector represents the defaults to be used by blocks if they don't declare anything.

### Settings

The settings section has the following structure and default values:

```
{
  "settings": {
    "some/block": {
      "border": {
        "customRadius": false /* true to opt-in */
      },
      "color": {
        "custom": true, /* false to opt-out, as in add_theme_support('disable-custom-colors') */
        "customGradient": true, /* false to opt-out, as in add_theme_support('disable-custom-gradients') */
        "gradients": [ ... ], /* gradient presets, as in add_theme_support('editor-gradient-presets', ... ) */
        "link": false, /* true to opt-in, as in add_theme_support('experimental-link-color') */
        "palette": [ ... ], /* color presets, as in add_theme_support('editor-color-palette', ... ) */
      },
      "custom": { ... },
      "spacing": {
        "customPadding": false, /* true to opt-in, as in add_theme_support('custom-spacing') */
        "units": [ "px", "em", "rem", "vh", "vw" ], /* filter values, as in add_theme_support('custom-units', ... ) */
      },
      "typography": {
        "customFontSize": true, /* false to opt-out, as in add_theme_support( 'disable-custom-font-sizes' ) */
        "customFontWeight": true, /* false to opt-out */
        "customFontStyle": true, /* false to opt-out */
        "customLineHeight": false, /* true to opt-in, as in add_theme_support( 'custom-line-height' ) */
        "dropCap": true, /* false to opt-out */
        "fontFamilies": [ ... ], /* font family presets */
        "fontSizes": [ ... ], /* font size presets, as in add_theme_support('editor-font-sizes', ... ) */
        "fontStyles": [ ... ], /* font style presets */
        "fontWeights": [ ... ], /* font weight presets */
        "textDecorations": [ ... ], /* text decoration presets */
        "textTransforms": [ ... ] /* text transform presets */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each block can configure any of these settings separately, providing a more fine-grained control over what exists via `add_theme_support`.

The block settings declared under the `defaults` block selector affect to all blocks, unless a particular block overwrites it. It's a way to provide inheritance and quickly configure all blocks at once. To retain backward compatibility, the existing `add_theme_support` declarations that configure the block editor are retrofit in the proper categories for the `defaults` section. If a theme uses `add_theme_support('disable-custom-colors')`, it'll be the same as set `settings.defaults.color.custom` to `false`. If the `experimental-theme.json` contains any settings, these will take precedence over the values declared via `add_theme_support`.

Let's say a theme author wants to enable custom colors only for the paragraph block. This is how it can be done:

```
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "color": {
        "custom": false // Disable it for all blocks.
      }
    },
    "core/paragraph": {
      "color": {
        "custom": true // Paragraph overrides the setting.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note, however, that not all settings are relevant for all blocks. The settings section provides an opt-in/opt-out mechanism for themes, but it's the block's responsibility to add support for the features that are relevant to it. For example, if a block doesn't implement the `dropCap` feature, a theme can't enable it for such a block through `experimental-theme.json`.

#### Presets

Presets are part of the settings section. Each preset value will generate a CSS Custom Property that will be added to the new stylesheet, which follow this naming schema: `--wp--preset--{preset-category}--{preset-slug}`.

For example:

{% codetabs %}
{% Input %}
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "color": {
        "palette": [
          {
            "slug": "strong-magenta",
            "color": "#a156b4"
          },
          {
            "slug": "very-dark-grey",
            "color": "rgb(131, 12, 8)"
          }
        ],
        "gradients": [
          {
            "slug": "blush-bordeaux",
            "gradient": "linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(254,205,165) 0%,rgb(254,45,45) 50%,rgb(107,0,62) 100%)"
          },
          {
            "slug": "blush-light-purple",
            "gradient": "linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(255,206,236) 0%,rgb(152,150,240) 100%)"
          },
        ]
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontSizes": [
          {
            "slug": "normal",
            "size": 16
          },
          {
            "slug": "big",
            "size": 32
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% Output %}
```css
:root {
  --wp--preset--color--strong-magenta: #a156b4;
  --wp--preset--color--very-dark-gray: #444;
  --wp--preset--font-size--big: 32;
  --wp--preset--font-size--normal: 16;
  --wp--preset--gradient--blush-bordeaux: linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(254,205,165) 0%,rgb(254,45,45) 50%,rgb(107,0,62) 100%);
  --wp--preset--gradient--blush-light-purple: linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(255,206,236) 0%,rgb(152,150,240) 100%);
}
```
{% end %}

To maintain backward compatibility, the presets declared via `add_theme_support` will also generate the CSS Custom Properties. If the `experimental-theme.json` contains any presets, these will take precedence over the ones declared via `add_theme_support`.

#### Free-form CSS Custom Properties

In addition to create CSS Custom Properties for the presets, the `experimental-theme.json` also allows for themes to create their own, so they don't have to be enqueued separately. Any values declared within the `settings.<some/block>.custom` section will be transformed to CSS Custom Properties following this naming schema: `--wp--custom--<variable-name>`.

For example:

{% codetabs %}
{% Input %}
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "custom": {
        "base-font": 16,
        "line-height": {
          "small": 1.2,
          "medium": 1.4,
          "large": 1.8
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% Output %}
```css
:root {
  --wp--custom--base-font: 16;
  --wp--custom--line-height--small: 1.2;
  --wp--custom--line-height--medium: 1.4;
  --wp--custom--line-height--large: 1.8;
}
```
{% end %}

Note that, the name of the variable is created by adding `--` in between each nesting level.

### Styles

Each block declares which style properties it exposes via the [block supports mechanism](../block-api/block-supports.md). The support declarations are used to automatically generate the UI controls for the block in the editor, as well as being available through the `experimental-theme.json` file for themes to target.

```json
{
  "styles": {
    "some/block/selector": {
      "border": {
        "radius": "value"
      },
      "color": {
        "background": "value",
        "gradient": "value",
        "link": "value",
        "text": "value"
      },
      "spacing": {
        "padding": {
          "top": "value",
          "right": "value",
          "bottom": "value",
          "left": "value",
        },
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontFamily": "value",
        "fontSize": "value",
        "fontStyle": "value",
        "fontWeight": "value",
        "lineHeight": "value",
        "textDecoration": "value",
        "textTransform": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For example:

{% codetabs %}
{% Input %}
```json
{
  "styles": {
    "root": {
      "color": {
        "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--primary)"
      },
    },
    "core/heading/h1": {
      "color": {
        "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--primary)"
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontSize": "calc(1px * var(--wp--preset--font-size--huge))"
      }
    },
    "core/heading/h4": {
      "color": {
        "text": "var(--wp--preset--color--secondary)"
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontSize": "var(--wp--preset--font-size--normal)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% Output %}
```css
:root {
  color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary);
}
h1 {
  color: var(--wp--preset--color--primary);
  font-size: calc(1px * var(--wp--preset--font-size--huge));
}
h4 {
  color: var(--wp--preset--color--secondary);
  font-size: calc(1px * var(--wp--preset--font-size--normal));
}
```
{% end %}

The `defaults` block selector can't be part of the `styles` section and will be ignored if it's present. The `root` block selector will generate a style rule with the `:root` CSS selector.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The naming schema of CSS Custom Properties

One thing you may have noticed is the naming schema used for the CSS Custom Properties the system creates, including the use of double hyphen, `--`, to separate the different "concepts". Take the following examples.

**Presets** such as `--wp--preset--color--black` can be divided into the following chunks:

- `--wp`: prefix to namespace the CSS variable.
- `preset `: indicates is a CSS variable that belongs to the presets.
- `color`: indicates which preset category the variable belongs to. It can be `color`, `font-size`, `gradients`.
- `black`: the `slug` of the particular preset value.

**Custom** properties such as `--wp--custom--line-height--body`, which can be divided into the following chunks:

- `--wp`: prefix to namespace the CSS variable.
- `custom`: indicates is a "free-form" CSS variable created by the theme.
- `line-height--body`: the result of converting the "custom" object keys into a string.

The `--` as a separator has two functions:

- Readibility, for human understanding. It can be thought as similar to the BEM naming schema, it separates "categories".
- Parseability, for machine understanding. Using a defined structure allows machines to understand the meaning of the property `--wp--preset--color--black`: it's a value bounded to the color preset whose slug is "black", which then gives us room to do more things with them.

### Why using `--` as a separator?

We could have used any other separator, such as a single `-`.

However, that'd have been problematic, as it'd have been impossible to tell how `--wp-custom-line-height-template-header` should be converted back into an object, unless we force theme authors not to use `-` in their variable names.

By reserving `--` as a category separator and let theme authors use `-` for word-boundaries, the naming is clearer: `--wp--custom--line-height--template-header`.

### How settings under "custom" create new CSS Custom Properties

The algorithm to create CSS Variables out of the settings under the "custom" key works this way:

This is for clarity, but also because we want a mechanism to parse back a variable name such `--wp--custom--line-height--body` to its object form in theme.json. We use the same separation for presets.

For example:

{% codetabs %}
{% Input %}
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "custom": {
        "lineHeight": {
          "body": 1.7
        },
        "font-primary": "-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"
      },
    },
  },
}
```
{% Output %}
```css
:root {
  --wp--custom--line-height--body: 1.7;
  --wp--custom--font-primary: "-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif",
}
```
{% end %}

A few notes about this process:

- `camelCased` keys are transformed into its `kebab-case` form, as to follow the CSS property naming schema. Example: `lineHeight` is transformed into `line-height`.
- Keys at different depth levels are separated by `--`. That's why `line-height` and `body` are separated by `--`.
- You shouldn't use `--` in the names of the keys within the `custom` object. Example, **don't do** this:


```json
{
  "settings": {
    "defaults": {
      "custom": {
        "line--height": {
          "body": 1.7
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
