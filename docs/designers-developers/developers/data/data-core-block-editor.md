# **core/block-editor**: The Block Editorâ€™s Data

## Selectors

### getBlockDependantsCacheBust

Returns a new reference when the inner blocks of a given block client ID
change. This is used exclusively as a memoized selector dependant, relying
on this selector's shared return value and recursively those of its inner
blocks defined as dependencies. This abuses mechanics of the selector
memoization to return from the original selector function only when
dependants change.

*Parameters*

 * state: Editor state.
 * clientId: Block client ID.

the client ID.

The 'utility' property indicates how useful we think an item will be to the
user. There are 4 levels of utility:

1. Blocks that are contextually useful (utility = 3)
2. Blocks that have been previously inserted (utility = 2)
3. Blocks that are in the common category (utility = 1)
4. All other blocks (utility = 0)

The 'frecency' property is a heuristic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency)
that combines block usage frequenty and recency.

Items are returned ordered descendingly by their 'utility' and 'frecency'.
