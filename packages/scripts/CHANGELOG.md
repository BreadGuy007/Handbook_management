### New Features

- The bundled `webpack` dependency has been updated from requiring `4.8.3` to requiring `^4.41.0` ([#17746](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17746)).

### Bug Fixes

- Added a temporary workaround for the default config used with `lint-js` command. It uses linting rules for both e2e and unit tests with all files until override files globbing logic is fixed when using `eslint` with `--config` (related [issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11558)).

## 5.0.0 (2019-09-16)

### Breaking Changes

- The bundled `@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin` dependency has been updated to the next major version `^2.0.0`. `start` and `build` scripts save now the generated asset file for each entry point in the new PHP output format.

## 4.1.0 (2019-09-03)

### New Features

- Add the new `env` family of scripts [(#17004](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17004/)).

## 4.0.0 (2019-08-29)

### Breaking Changes

- Test files matching has changed to fix the overlap between two types of tests implemented with `test-e2e` and `test-unit`. Refer to the documentation of the corresponding scripts to learn about new file discovery rules.

### New Features

- The bundled `puppeteer` dependency has been updated from requiring `1.6.1` to requiring `^1.19.0` ([#16875](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16875)). It uses Chromium v77 instead of Chromium v69.
- The bundled `jest-puppeteer` dependency has been updated from requiring `^4.0.0` to requiring `^4.3.0` ([#16875](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16875)).
- The bundled `eslint` dependency has been updated from requiring `^5.16.0` to requiring `^6.1.0`.
- The bundled `@wordpress/eslint-plugin` dependency has been updated to the next major version `^3.0.0` due to new ESLint rules enabled for all test files.

### Bug Fix

- Use the SCSS shared `stylelint-config-wordpress` config so that both CSS and SCSS rules are used ([#17060](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/17060))

## 3.4.0 (2019-08-05)

- The `lint-pkg-json` command lints now `package.json` files in the entire project's directories by default ([15890](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15890)).
- The `lint-style` command lints now CSS and SCSS files in the entire project's directories by default ([15890](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15890)).
- The `lint-js`, `lint-pkg-json` and `lint-style` commands ignore now files located in `build` and `node_modules` folders by default ([15977](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15977)).

## 3.2.0 (2019-05-21)

  dependencies.

### Enhancements

- The default Webpack configuration now opts-in to [the `cacheDirectory` option](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/#options) for its Babel loader.
- The `source-map-loader` is excluded from production builds. This serves only as an optimization and should otherwise have no impact on build results.
