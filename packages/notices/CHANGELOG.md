### New Feature

- The `createNotice` can now optionally accept a WPNotice object as the sole argument.
- New option `speak` enables control as to whether the notice content is announced to screen readers (defaults to `true`)

### Bug Fixes

- While `createNotice` only explicitly supported content of type `string`, it was not previously enforced. This has been corrected.
