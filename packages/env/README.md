# `wp-env`

`wp-env` lets you easily set up a local WordPress environment for building and testing plugins and themes. It's simple to install and requires no configuration.

## Quick (tl;dr) instructions

Ensure that Docker is running, then:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/a/wordpress/plugin
$ npx wp-env start
```

The local environment will be available at http://localhost:8888.

## Instructions

### Installation

`wp-env` requires Docker to be installed. There are instructions available for installing Docker on [Windows 10 Pro](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/), [all other versions of Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).

After confirming that Docker is installed, you can install `wp-env` globally like so:

```sh
$ npm -g i @wordpress/env
```

You're now ready to use `wp-env`!

### Starting the environment

First, ensure that Docker is running. You can do this by clicking on the Docker icon in the system tray or menu bar.

Then, change to a directory that contains a WordPress plugin or theme:

```sh
$ cd ~/gutenberg
```

Then, start the local environment:

```sh
$ wp-env start
```

Finally, navigate to http://localhost:8888 in your web browser to see WordPress running with the local WordPress plugin or theme running and activated.

### Stopping the environment

To stop the local environment:

```sh
$ wp-env stop
```

## Troubleshooting common problems

Many common problems can be fixed by running through the following troubleshooting steps in order:

### 1. Check that `wp-env` is running

First, check that `wp-env` is running. One way to do this is to have Docker print a table with the currently running containers:

```sh
$ docker ps
```

In this table, by default, you should see three entries: `wordpress` with port 8888, `tests-wordpress` with port 8889 and `mariadb` with port 3306.

### 2. Check the port number

By default `wp-env` uses port 8888, meaning that the local environment will be available at http://localhost:8888.

You can configure the port that `wp-env` uses so that it doesn't clash with another server by specifying the `WP_ENV_PORT` environment variable when starting `wp-env`:

```sh
$ WP_ENV_PORT=3333 wp-env start
```

Running `docker ps` and inspecting the `PORTS` column allows you to determine which port `wp-env` is currently using.

### 3. Restart `wp-env`

Restarting `wp-env` will restart the underlying Docker containers which can fix many issues.

To restart `wp-env`:

```sh
$ wp-env stop
$ wp-env start
```

### 4. Restart Docker

Restarting Docker will restart the underlying Docker containers and volumes which can fix many issues.

To restart Docker:

1. Click on the Docker icon in the system tray or menu bar.
2. Select _Restart_.

Once restarted, start `wp-env` again:

```sh
$ wp-env start
```

### 5. Reset the database

Resetting the database which the local environment uses can fix many issues, especially when they are related to the WordPress installation.

To reset the database:

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will permanently delete any posts, pages, media, etc. in the local WordPress installation.**

```sh
$ wp-env clean all
$ wp-env start
```

### 6. Nuke everything and start again üî•

When all else fails, you can try forcibly removing all of the underlying Docker containers and volumes, the underlying WordPress directory, and starting again from scratch.

To nuke everything:

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will permanently delete any posts, pages, media, etc. in the local WordPress installation.**

```sh
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
$ docker volume rm -f $(docker volume ls -q)
$ rm -rf "../$(basename $(pwd))-wordpress"
$ wp-env start
```

## Command reference

### `wp-env start [ref]`

```sh
wp-env start [ref]

Starts WordPress for development on port 8888 (‚Äãhttp://localhost:8888‚Äã)
(override with WP_ENV_PORT) and tests on port 8889 (‚Äãhttp://localhost:8889‚Äã)
(override with WP_ENV_TESTS_PORT). If the current working directory is a plugin
and/or has e2e-tests with plugins and/or mu-plugins, they will be mounted
appropriately.

Positionals:
  ref  A `https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress` git repo branch or commit for
       choosing a specific version.                 [string] [default: "master"]
```

### `wp-env stop`

```sh
wp-env stop

Stops running WordPress for development and tests and frees the ports.
```

### `wp-env clean [environment]`

```sh
wp-env clean [environment]

Cleans the WordPress databases.

Positionals:
  environment  Which environments' databases to clean.
            [string] [choices: "all", "development", "tests"] [default: "tests"]
```

## Running with multiple plugins and/or themes

`wp-env` also supports a configuration file. At the moment, this is only used for loading extra themes and plugins that you may be developing together with your main one. The script will attach the specified theme and plugin directories as volumes on the docker containers so that changes you make to them exist in the WordPress instance.

### Example:

`wp-env.json`
```json
{
  "themes": [
    "../path/to/theme/dir"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "../path/to/plugin/dir"
  ]
}
```

### Caveats:

The file should be located in the same directory from which you run `wp-env` commands for a project. So if you are running `wp-env` in the root directory of a plugin, `wp-env.json` should also be located there. 

Each item in the `themes` or `plugins` array should be an absolute or relative path to the root of a different theme or plugin directory. Relative paths will be resolved from the current working directory, which means they will be resolved from the location of the `wp-env.json` file.
