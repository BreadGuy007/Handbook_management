# Storybook 

Storybook is an open-source tool that provides a sandbox to develop and visualize components in isolation. See the [Storybook site](https://storybook.js.org/) for more information about the tool. 

The Gutenberg project uses Storybook to view and work with the UI components developed in the WordPress packages.

Run locally in your development environment running: `npm run storybook:dev` from the top-level Gutenberg directory.
