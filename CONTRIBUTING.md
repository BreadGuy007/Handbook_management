# Contributing

## Workflow

A good workflow is to work directly in this repo, branch off `master`, and submit your changes as a pull request.

Ideally name your branches with prefixes and descriptions, like this: `[type]/[change]`. A good prefix would be:

- `add/` = add a new feature
- `try/` = experimental feature, "tentatively add"
- `update/` = update an existing feature

For example, `add/foo-module` means you're working on adding a new foo module. 

You can pick among all the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/packages/issues">tickets</a>, or some of the ones labelled <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/packages/labels/Good%20First%20Task">Good First Task</a>.
